# Avito Project

This project focuses on analyzing and detecting prohibited content within Avito's classified ads. Utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks, it encompasses data preprocessing, sampling strategies, and the development of classification algorithms to identify inappropriate listings.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `projekat.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data analysis and model development.
- `sampling.ipynb`: Notebook dedicated to data sampling techniques.
- `avito_ProhibitedContent_SampleCode.py`: Sample code for detecting prohibited content.
- `translate.py`: Script for translating text data, if necessary.
- `APatK.py`: Auxiliary script for additional processing tasks.
- `Avito.docx`: Documentation detailing project objectives, methodologies, and findings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for scripting and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for data exploration and model building.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model development and evaluation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visualization libraries (if applicable).
- **NLTK / SpaCy**: Natural Language Processing tools (optional based on notebook content).
- **Googletrans**: For translation (based on presence of `translate.py`).
